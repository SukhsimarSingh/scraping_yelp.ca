"I'm Filipino and biased, but I firmly believe with all my heart and tastebuds that Jollibee's spicy fried chicken is the best fastfood fried chicken out there. (I am objective enough to also know this isn't the case for the original fried chicken).Other go-to's:- Jolly Spaghetti: Sweet spaghetti. Sounds weird? Yes it is. But it pairs sooooo well with the spicy fried chicken! And at the very least, it's an experience for you out there with the more refined (or snooty) palettes.- Peach Mango Pie: Apply pie shmapple pie. Get that outta here! Peach mango pie is the undisputed champ of fastfood chain desserts! They have other flavours like banana-jackfruit and ube, but this isnthenbest of them.Jollibee is not perfect fastfood (fries are limp, burgers are flat and dry-ish). But I always leave it with a satisified belly and a smile on my face. Till next time!",David Y.,4 star rating,"Toronto, ON"
"I am Filipino and although Jollibee has been in Canada for several years now, I hadn't tried it until recently.  I got the chicken meal with rice and gravy.  My partner got the chicken sandwich.  We also got a mango peach pie and a banana pie.  The chicken was delicious and crispy.  I love it with a bit of gravy and rice.  My partner really liked the sandwich and the pies were amazing.  The staff were incredibly friendly.  They'll be my go to for fast food fried chicken!",Lisa B.,5 star rating,"Toronto, ON"

"My Filipino friends introduced me to Jollibee. It's the best fried chicken IMO. Love their spicy fried chicken and the pineapple quench! Very satisfying. Not a fan of their pasta, it's kind of sweet. Other people might like it.",佳琛,4 star rating,"Toronto, ON"
"I'd been curious about Jollibee for a long time, so I was excited when I found out a location would be opening in my neck of the woods.I happened to be out for a walk on an unseasonably warm December day when I made the spontaneous decision to walk inside and grab something for lunch.I suppose Jollibee is most famous for their spaghetti and fried chicken, but those aren't exactly items you can eat and walk, so I opted for the Spicy Deluxe Chicken Sandwich (""Our Spicy Chicken Sandwich starts with a crispy juicy hand-breaded chicken breast fillet, spread with sriracha mayo, topped  with fresh sliced tomato and crisp lettuce, and served with fresh jalapenos on a toasted brioche bun"").I had a good view of the kitchen from where I was standing, so I saw the guy make my sandwich and then start to hand it off to the cashier, but then he quickly took it back and added the aforementioned tomato and lettuce. I didn't get any jalapenos.It's a decent sandwich. The chicken is neither fresh nor hot, but it at least does boast a decent crunch. The sparsely-applied sriracha mayo doesn't provide much in the way of heat, so the sandwich isn't, despite the name, particularly spicy. The missing jalapenos probably would've helped.I'll definitely be returning to try some of Jollibee's other items, but based on this first experience, I'm not holding much hope for a top-tier experience.",David N.,3 star rating,"Toronto, ON"
"I've been waiting forever for this location to open up! They had the sign up for months and it wasn't until last week when I saw they were opening their doors on September 10th!Knowing how popular Jollibee is, I placed my order on their website for pickup. I recall visiting their first location in Scarborough when it first opened. Even if you visit to their store at 11pm at night, the lineup is still out the door and you need to wait for your order! This is the main reason why I haven't had Jollibee until now. When I went to pick up my order, I see they had arrangements for lineups outside for walk in as well as a line for order pick up. When I stepped inside, I saw there's people lining up at the counter as well as people seated in their sitting area waiting for their orders. They had a staff at the entrance, I told him I placed an order online, and they had my order ready at their pick up shelf. It was a quick and easy experience and the staff was friendly and quick! I ordered the 6 piece bucket with half original and half spicy flavour. The original flavour itself was very tasty, but I wanted to challenge my taste buds with the spicy option. The spicy flavour was delicious also, but I personally find it a little spicy for me (I can't take a lot of heat). For those who love spice should totally go for the spicy option! I do need to go back to pick up their peach mango pie!",Daisy W.,5 star rating,"Old Toronto, Toronto, ON"
